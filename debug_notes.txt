UPDATE: If you're changing dex entries amount to over 1000, you need to adjust dexSeenFlags and dexCaughtFlags in SaveBlock1 structure in global.h file in CFRU. Fortunately, there's filler empty space after these flags, so expanding them isn't a hassle. There are exactly 328 bytes allocated for seen flags and caught flags + filler. That allows for expanding to maximum of 1304 dex entries without some heavy save space rearranging.

UPDATE 2: Additional file that needs changing is bytereplacement where you need to adjust RAM pointer ofdexCaughtFlags accordingly
